The goal of this project is have a drum machine that supports polyrhythms using Tone.js.

Project Plan

Phase 1:
1. Create basic data models for a Track, Measure, and Beat
2. Implement basic UI that lets you check boxes signifying quarter notes for two 4/4 measures.
3. Implement Tone.js loop that plays a snare sound for each checked box.


Phase 2:
1. Add the ability to change the time signature for a track.


Phase 3:
1. Let the user add tracks.
